# NeuroRust
NeuroRust is a powerful Rust library designed for EEG signal processing, providing a robust set of tools for analyzing and manipulating electroencephalography (EEG) data. Leveraging the efficiency and safety features of Rust, NeuroRust offers high-performance processing capabilities while ensuring memory safety and thread concurrency.

# Features:
### Signal Filtering: 
Apply various digital filters such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, or FIR filters to preprocess EEG signals.
### Spectral Analysis:
Perform frequency domain analysis including FFT, power spectral density estimation, and spectral coherence.
### Artifact Removal:
Implement techniques for removing artifacts from EEG signals, such as eye blinks or muscle activity.
### Event Detection:
Detect and extract events or patterns of interest in EEG data, such as spikes or epileptic seizures.
### Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from EEG signals for classification or further analysis.
### Connectivity Analysis:
Compute functional connectivity measures to analyze interactions between different brain regions.
### Visualization:
Visualize EEG data and analysis results using built-in plotting functions or integration with popular plotting libraries.
